# ✈️ Flight Booking Automation Framework

A robust Selenium test automation framework designed for end-to-end testing of a flight booking web application. Built with **proven design patterns** for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

## ✨ Features

### Core Framework
- Page Object Model (POM) with composition pattern
- Modular layered architecture (Infrastructure → Domain → Test)
- Centralized WebDriver utilities with instance-based interaction model
- Configuration-driven wait and timeout strategy (no hardcoded waits in Page Objects)
- Comprehensive Log4j2 logging with MDC context

### Testing Capabilities
- Data-driven testing (JSON, CSV, DataFaker)
- Cross-browser parallel execution via Jenkins pipeline stages and Selenium Grid
- Intelligent retry mechanism for transient failures

### AI Capabilities (Optional)
- LLM-based test data generation with provider-agnostic design (Ollama/OpenAI)
- AI-powered failure root cause analysis integrated into CI pipeline as an optional post-processing step
- AI-driven test scenario generation

These capabilities are non-blocking and do not affect core test execution.

### Execution & Infrastructure
- Dockerized Selenium Grid with isolated networks
- Config-driven environment execution (QA/Staging/Production)
- Integrated Jenkins CI/CD pipeline using shared library architecture

### Reporting & Quality Gates
- ExtentReports with screenshots and timelines
- Consolidated HTML dashboards in CI/CD
- Automated quality gates with configurable thresholds
- Failure aggregation and status-change-based notifications

## 🚀 Getting Started

This section covers **local and CI-style execution**. For CI/CD internals and architecture, see the documentation links below.

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Apache Maven 3.8+
- Docker Desktop (for grid execution)

### How to Run Tests

The framework supports two primary modes of execution: running tests locally on your machine for development and debugging, and running them against a Dockerized Selenium Grid for CI/CD or comprehensive cross-browser testing.

> These commands mirror how the framework executes inside Jenkins CI.

#### 1. Running from the Command Line (using Maven)

This is the recommended approach for running full test suites. These commands reflect **how the framework is executed in CI**, with local overrides for development.

**A) Local Execution (No Docker Grid)**

This mode runs tests on your local browser with automatic driver management. It's ideal for quick feedback during development.

```bash
# Run the smoke suite on your local Chrome browser
mvn clean test -P smoke -Dselenium.grid.enabled=false

# Run the regression suite on your local Firefox browser
mvn clean test -P regression -Dbrowser=firefox -Dselenium.grid.enabled=false
```

**B) Dockerized Selenium Grid Execution**

This mode is used by the CI/CD pipeline and is ideal for running the full regression suite across multiple browsers in parallel.

```bash
# 1. Start the Selenium Grid in the background
docker-compose -f docker-compose-grid.yml up -d

# 2. Run the smoke suite against the grid (defaults to Chrome)
mvn clean test -P smoke -Dselenium.grid.enabled=true

# 3. Shut down the grid when you're finished
docker-compose -f docker-compose-grid.yml down
```

#### 2. Running from an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)

For debugging, tests can also be run directly from the IDE with:
```
-Dselenium.grid.enabled=false
```

## 📊 Test Reports

After test execution, detailed HTML reports are available in:
- `reports/{browser}/` - Individual test run reports
- `target/surefire-reports/` - TestNG reports and logs

Reports are generated **per browser execution** and aggregated in CI.

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `src/test/resources/config/config.properties` to configure:
- Test environment (PRODUCTION/STAGING/QA)
- Browser settings and headless mode
- Timeouts and retry configurations
- Reporting preferences and tester information

Configuration is externalized to support non-code environment changes in CI/CD.

### Test Data Formats

The framework supports multiple test data formats:
- **JSON**: Structured test data in `src/test/resources/testdata/` directory
- **CSV**: Tabular test data for data-driven scenarios
- **DataFaker**: Dynamic, seeded test data generation for realistic and reproducible negative testing

### Test Suites

- **Smoke Suite**: Quick validation tests (`testng-smoke.xml`)
- **Regression Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage (`testng-regression.xml`)

## 📚 Architecture & CI/CD Documentation

This repository intentionally separates **architectural intent** from **execution behavior**.
